## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" error
**Symptoms:** Console shows TypeError: Failed to fetch
**Cause:** Backend not running OR frontend can't connect
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running:
curl http://localhost:8000/api/courses

# If not responding, restart backend:
cd e:\Projects\client\Suresh_Sir_Arch\backend
winvenv\Scripts\python.exe run_server.py

# Check frontend dev server:
cd e:\Projects\client\Suresh_Sir_Arch\arch-client-web-1.0-main\arch-client-web-1.0-main
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "My Courses" shows 0
**Symptoms:** Page loads but shows no courses
**Cause:** You haven't enrolled in any courses yet!
**Solution:** This is NORMAL! Go to `/courses` and enroll in a course first.

### Issue: Can't see enrollment status
**Symptoms:** All courses show "Enroll Now" even after enrolling
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
2. Check if you're logged in (Profile icon in header)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try logging out and back in

### Issue: Button says "Enroll Now" but I'm enrolled
**Symptoms:** Green badge shows but button is still purple
**Solution:**
1. This was the OLD bug - now FIXED!
2. Make sure you refreshed the page after my fixes
3. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
4. Should now show green "View Course" button

### Issue: "Enrollment Required" when accessing player
**Symptoms:** Can't access `/learn/course/[id]`
**Cause:** You're not enrolled in that specific course
**Solution:**
1. Click "Enroll Now" button on the screen
2. Or go back to `/courses/[id]` and enroll
3. Then access the player again

## 🚨 Important Notes

### For "Failed to fetch" Error:
This error appears when:
1. Backend is not running → Start backend
2. Frontend can't reach backend → Check ports (8000 for backend, 3000 for frontend)
3. CORS issue → Already configured, should work
4. Network issue → Check firewalls

**My fix:** The page now handles this gracefully. If backend is down, you'll see a warning in console but page won't crash. You can still browse courses (from cache/initial load).

### For "My Courses" Showing 0:
This is EXPECTED if you haven't enrolled yet!
- Go to /courses
- Enroll in a course
- Return to My Courses
- Now shows your enrolled courses

### For Green Badge Not Showing:
Make sure:
1. You're logged in
2. You actually enrolled (check My Courses page)
3. Page is refreshed (Ctrl + Shift + R)
4. Backend is running
5. No console errors

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always hard refresh after enrolling** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
   - Ensures enrollment status is updated

2. **Check browser console for hints**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for ✅ or ⚠️ messages
   - I added helpful logging!

3. **Verify you're logged in**
   - Look for "Profile" and "Logout" in header
   - If not visible → Login again

4. **Test backend health**
   - Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Should show FastAPI Swagger docs

5. **Use the green button!**
   - After enrolling, button turns green
   - Says "Go to Course Player"
   - Click it to access your course

---
