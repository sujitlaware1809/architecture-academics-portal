## User Flow

### Course Enrollment Flow
1. User visits course detail page
2. System checks if user is authenticated and enrolled
3. User clicks "Enroll Now" button
4. If not authenticated → Redirect to login
5. If authenticated → Create enrollment via API
6. Show success message
7. Redirect to "My Courses" page
8. User can continue learning from course detail page or my courses page

### Viewing Enrolled Content Flow
1. User navigates to Profile
2. Clicks on:
   - "My Courses" → See all enrolled courses
   - "My Events" → See all registered events
   - "My Workshops" → See all registered workshops
3. Can filter by status (All/In Progress/Completed or All/Upcoming/Past)
4. Can view details by clicking on individual items
5. Empty states guide users to browse content if no enrollments/registrations

## Next Steps (Pending)
