# Event/Workshop Status Filter Fix ✅

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Problem

**Issue**: Events created from admin dashboard were NOT appearing on the public `/events` page

**Root Cause**: Status filter mismatch between database and API endpoint

### Technical Details:

1. **Event Status Enum** (backend/schemas.py):
   ```python
   class EventStatus(str, Enum):
       UPCOMING = "upcoming"      # Default when creating
       ONGOING = "ongoing"
       COMPLETED = "completed"
       CANCELLED = "cancelled"
   ```

2. **Event Model Default** (backend/database.py):
   ```python
   status = Column(..., default=EventStatus.UPCOMING)  # New events get "upcoming"
   ```

3. **Public Endpoint Filter** (backend/main.py - BEFORE FIX):
   ```python
   # ❌ THIS WAS WRONG!
   crud.get_events(db, status="published")  # "published" doesn't exist in EventStatus!
   ```

4. **Result**: Events with status "upcoming" were filtered out, so public page showed nothing!

---

## Solution

Changed public endpoints to show `UPCOMING` and `ONGOING` events (excludes completed and cancelled):

### Events Endpoint Fixed:
```python
# BEFORE (backend/main.py line 2739)
@app.get("/events", response_model=List[schemas.EventResponse])
async def get_public_events(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """Get all published events for public view"""
    return crud.get_events(db, skip=skip, limit=limit, status="published")  # ❌ WRONG!

# AFTER (✅ FIXED)
@app.get("/events", response_model=List[schemas.EventResponse])
async def get_public_events(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """Get all upcoming and ongoing events for public view (excludes completed and cancelled)"""
    all_events = crud.get_events(db, skip=skip, limit=limit)
    return [e for e in all_events if e.status in ["upcoming", "ongoing"]]  # ✅ CORRECT!
```

### Workshops Endpoint Fixed:
```python
# BEFORE (backend/main.py line 2750)
@app.get("/workshops", response_model=List[schemas.WorkshopResponse])
async def get_public_workshops(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """Get all published workshops for public view"""
    return crud.get_workshops(db, skip=skip, limit=limit, status="published")  # ❌ WRONG!

# AFTER (✅ FIXED)
@app.get("/workshops", response_model=List[schemas.WorkshopResponse])
async def get_public_workshops(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """Get all upcoming and ongoing workshops for public view (excludes completed and cancelled)"""
    all_workshops = crud.get_workshops(db, skip=skip, limit=limit)
    return [w for w in all_workshops if w.status in ["upcoming", "ongoing"]]  # ✅ CORRECT!
```

### Courses Endpoint:
Courses use a different status system and already work correctly:
```python
class CourseStatus(str, Enum):
    DRAFT = "draft"        # Default
    PUBLISHED = "published"
    ARCHIVED = "archived"

# Public endpoint is correct (already filters by "published")
@app.get("/courses", response_model=List[schemas.CourseResponse])
async def get_public_courses(...):
    return crud.get_courses(db, status="published")  # ✅ This is correct!
```

**Note**: For courses, admin must set status to "published" for them to appear on public page.

## Status Systems Summary

### Events & Workshops:
- Default: `"upcoming"`
- Public shows: `"upcoming"` and `"ongoing"`
- Hidden: `"completed"` and `"cancelled"`

### Courses:
- Default: `"draft"`
- Public shows: `"published"` only
- Hidden: `"draft"` and `"archived"`

---

## Testing

### ✅ Events:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin/events`
3. Create new event (status will be "upcoming" by default)
4. Go to public `/events` page
5. **Event should now appear!** ✅

### ✅ Workshops:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin/workshops`
3. Create new workshop (status will be "upcoming" by default)
4. Go to public `/workshops` page
5. **Workshop should now appear!** ✅

### ⚠️ Courses:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin/courses`
3. Create new course (status will be "draft" by default)
4. Go to public `/courses` page
5. **Course will NOT appear** (status is "draft")
6. Go back to `/admin/courses`
7. Edit course and change status to "published"
8. Go to public `/courses` page
9. **Now course appears!** ✅

## Admin Status Management

Admin can change status of events/workshops/courses from the dashboard:

### Events Status Dropdown:
- Upcoming (default for new events)
- Ongoing
- Completed (hidden from public)
- Cancelled (hidden from public)

### Workshops Status Dropdown:
- Upcoming (default for new workshops)
- Ongoing
- Completed (hidden from public)
- Cancelled (hidden from public)

### Courses Status Dropdown:
- Draft (default for new courses, hidden from public)
- Published (visible on public page)
- Archived (hidden from public)

---

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- ✅ `backend/main.py` - Lines 2739-2746 (Events endpoint)
- ✅ `backend/main.py` - Lines 2750-2757 (Workshops endpoint)

---

## Restart Required

⚠️ **You must restart the backend server for changes to take effect:**

```bash
# In WSL terminal
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python run_server.py
```

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Events Flow:
```
Admin creates event
    ↓
Status = "upcoming" (default)
    ↓
Public /events endpoint
    ↓
Shows events with status: "upcoming" OR "ongoing"
    ↓
✅ Event appears on public page!
```

### ✅ Workshops Flow:
```
Admin creates workshop
    ↓
Status = "upcoming" (default)
    ↓
Public /workshops endpoint
    ↓
Shows workshops with status: "upcoming" OR "ongoing"
    ↓
✅ Workshop appears on public page!
```

### ⚠️ Courses Flow:
```
Admin creates course
    ↓
Status = "draft" (default)
    ↓
Public /courses endpoint
    ↓
Shows ONLY courses with status: "published"
    ↓
❌ Course does NOT appear (status is "draft")
    ↓
Admin changes status to "published"
    ↓
✅ Course now appears on public page!
```

---

## Summary

**Fixed!** Events and workshops now appear on public pages immediately after creation with their default "upcoming" status. Courses require status to be changed to "published" by admin to appear publicly.

This is the correct behavior:
- **Events/Workshops**: Show upcoming and ongoing (hide completed/cancelled)
- **Courses**: Show published only (hide drafts and archived)

🎉 **Admin-created content now appears on public pages in real-time!**
