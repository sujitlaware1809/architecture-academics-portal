# Admin Dashboard Real-Time Data Integration - FIXED ✅

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Error: `/users/me` endpoint not found (404)
**Problem**: Frontend pages were calling `/users/me` which doesn't exist in backend
**Solution**: Changed to correct endpoint `/auth/me`

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/blogs/page.tsx` - Line 56
- `app/profile/setup/page.tsx` - Line 88

```typescript
// BEFORE
const user = await api.get("/users/me")

// AFTER
const user = await api.get("/auth/me")
```

---

### 2. ❌ Error: Event creation failing with validation error
**Problem**: `EventResponse` schema requires `participants_count` field, but `create_event()` wasn't setting it
**Backend Error:**
```
ResponseValidationError: Field required 'participants_count'
```

**Solution**: Added `participants_count = 0` to newly created events

**File Fixed:**
- `backend/crud.py` - Line 1238-1249 in `create_event()`

```python
# BEFORE
def create_event(db: Session, event: schemas.EventCreate, organizer_id: Optional[int] = None):
    db_event = Event(**event.dict(), organizer_id=organizer_id)
    db.add(db_event)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_event)
    return db_event  # Missing participants_count!

# AFTER
def create_event(db: Session, event: schemas.EventCreate, organizer_id: Optional[int] = None):
    db_event = Event(**event.dict(), organizer_id=organizer_id)
    db.add(db_event)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_event)
    db_event.participants_count = 0  # ✅ Added for response validation
    return db_event
```

## Data Flow

```
Admin Dashboard → Backend API → Database → Public Pages
     ↓                ↓            ↓           ↓
  POST /admin    CRUD.create()  INSERT    GET /events
                                          GET /workshops
                                          GET /courses
```

### Example: Creating an Event
1. Admin fills form at `/admin/events`
2. Frontend calls `POST /admin/events` with JWT token
3. Backend validates admin role via `get_current_admin()`
4. `crud.create_event()` inserts into database
5. Sets `participants_count = 0` for response
6. Returns event with all required fields
7. Public page calls `GET /events`
8. Only events with `status="published"` are returned
