## Key Trends in Sustainable Design

### 1. Net-Zero Energy Buildings
Modern architects are focusing on designing buildings that produce as much energy as they consume. Through the integration of solar panels, wind turbines, and advanced insulation techniques, net-zero buildings are becoming more accessible and affordable.

### 2. Biophilic Design
Incorporating nature into built environments improves mental health and productivity. Living walls, natural lighting, and indoor gardens are essential elements in contemporary sustainable architecture.

The future of architecture lies in sustainability. As professionals in this field, we have the responsibility and opportunity to shape a better, greener future for generations to come.""",
